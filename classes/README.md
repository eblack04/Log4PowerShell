# Description
Each class is stored in its own module file.  This is different from the public and private directories, which have functions stored in their own script file.  The reason the class objects are stored in module files is so that they do not generate errors in an editor when the class makes use of other classes within the directory.  If a class makes use of another class in the directory, a "using module" statement is required for the editor to validate the class module as valid syntax.  When the classes are compiled into a single project-wide module file, the "using module" statements in each class module file are removed.
